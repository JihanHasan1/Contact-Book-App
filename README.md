# Contact-List-App

By using the app you can create contacts by inserting their name, phone numbers and email. Then you can view all the contacts in a list. You also can delete a contact by holding it. Moreover, you can update any value of a contact if you think there was a mistake.

Special Feature:
I have implemented both SQLite database and Remote Database in my app for storing data so that people do not loose their saved contacts even after data is erased accidentally

Note: This app was made for simple and limited use. More features could be added.

Skills: Remote Server 路 Image to Base64 Conversion 路 XML 路 SQLite 路 Java

Here is the Preview of my app:
